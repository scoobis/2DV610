## Coverage
The coverage is at 97,5 %.  
The reason it is not 100% is because the test tests themselves so some of them does not get covered for some reason.  
In RandomNumberGame I did not managed to test the loop. I got problem with the in stream and made it impossible to test. (as far as my knowledge goes.)  
The MathGame does not show 100% since it does not cover the if statements for some reason.  
They are tested so they should show 100%...
